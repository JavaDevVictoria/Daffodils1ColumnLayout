*1 COLUMN LAYOUT - README*

Thank you for downloading the 1 Column Layout created by Victoria Holland (victoria-holland.info).  This file was last updated in April 2012.

CONTENTS

This template includes 6 individual HTML files - index.html, about.html, services.html, contact.html, links.html and extra.html.  It also contains a style.css file which consists of the style definitions.  An image file - YellowDaffodils.jpg - has also been included, although you can substitute this for an image of your choice should you wish.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

1) Edit the paragraph text within each of the 6 individual HTML files, ie between the <p> and </p> tags.  If you would like more paragraphs, simply create more <p> and </p> tag pairs as necessary, and add the desired text inbetween.
2) In each of the HTML files, change the title between the <title> and </title> tags to the name of your website.
3) If you want to change the header image, you should use an image which is 600 pixels wide (or re-size it to this size), so that it is consistent with the rest of the layout.  Remember, if the new image has a different filename to YellowDaffodils.jpg, you will need to change the filename in the HTML files.  
4) If you don't want to use all 6 HTML pages, you can delete the relevant filenames from the section of the code which contains the navigation bar.
5) Once you have finished editing the files, you can then upload them to your webserver.
